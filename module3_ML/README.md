## 📌 Project Presentations

For the project, you should **apply one or more machine learning methods** presented in this module to a dataset of your choice.

- You may work **individually or in teams** (teams encouraged — more results, more fun).  
- Each group has **10–15 minutes** to present results  
  - You may use Jupyter notebooks, slides, or both  
- Afterwards, there will be **10–15 minutes** of feedback and questions from peers and instructors
