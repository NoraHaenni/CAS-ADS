# 🌐 CAS Repository – Meta Overview

This repository contains the complete collection of material provided for the **CAS-ADS program of the University of Bern from ILIAS**, including six main course modules and two *preparatory training* sections.  Actual developped code for the module projects cannot be disclosed to the public as it contains unpublished research - hence, this code is not contained and the repository is rather a collection of study material.
 
Each module or preparatory folder includes its own README with detailed documentation.
This meta-README provides an overview of the full repository structure and purpose.
