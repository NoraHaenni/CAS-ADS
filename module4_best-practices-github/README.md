# CAS Applied Data Science – Module 5: Best Practices, Security & Version Control

This repository contains materials and exercises for **Module 5**, part of the **CAS Applied Data Science** program at the **University of Bern**.

In this module, we reflect upon and apply **best practices for data and code management**, **resource usage**, **quality assurance**, **open science**, **open access**, and **FAIR principles**.  
You will also learn about ethical questions in scientific computing and gain hands-on experience with **version control using Git and GitHub**.
